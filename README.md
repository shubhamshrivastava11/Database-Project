# Round Theatre Avon Troupe's Data Management and Performance Analytics
• Designed and implemented a relational database system, including ER diagrams and integrity constraints, to efficiently manage member information, production details, ticket sales, and financial data for the troupe.
• Utilized SQL Server Analysis Services and Microsoft Association Rules in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to create OLAP mining structures and measures on Multidimensional Cubes.
• Implemented a system to track ticket sales, pricing, revenue generation, and financial data for each production, contributing to more effective budgeting and financial planning in order to improve the overall theater experience and future productions accordingly.
